We created La Perla with Tororaw & Marian (Domencia) as an art exploration. We
wanted to create a DJ booth by mapping with pixel led strings the whole
geodesic structure we created for [[Neurona]].

The main challenge was to map the geodesic links since there's no [Eulurian
Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path) that travels through every
edge exactly once.

First I created a scale model with 3d printed connectors in PLA and 3mm
diameter brochette sticks for the links. The model I used is: << get model url >>.

For this project I asked my father for help since it's his 3d printer and it
was my first time using it.

He hadn't used the 3d printers in a while and while trying printing and
calibrating everything one broke (and is still in the repair shop after a
year). Hopefully he had another one, a bit simpler with fewer sensors and
goodies that was easier to manipulate and pepare for the print.

This model presented me an intimate relationship with the shape that would
foreshadow many more geodesic projects in the future.

Being a DJ booth we decided to create a window for the dj to interact with the
audience by removing some links. This window modified the mapping a bit.

I decided to propritize an inteligible and common sense segment mappning more
than other metrics more efficient in less amount of segments, cables length or
connectors. I have to keep in mind that a segment cannot be longer than X leds.

This is the mapping I came up with made up of circles, zigzags and spiders
(albeit with 5 legs).

We created a custom esp32 box that we run wled in (we didn't have time to
program anything custom). Power injection on every strip.

Two kinds of connectors 5 sided and 6 sided



The idea of this project was to map the geodesic structure with pixelled
strings.For this I created a mapping tu use "intelligible"/common sense led
segments to map the whole sphere.


Their is no path that goes through all the edges.

Show the mapping from google docs.

Coming from the experience of [[Neurona]] having the sphere:

We created The Pearl with Tororaw & Marian (domencia) as an art exploration in
the framework of the [[El Club del Led]] to be used as a DJ Booth.

It's a geodesic sphere made by Marian himself created from the dimenisions of
Domencia but in the form of a Sphere.

The botttom "star" es different so it sits flat on the ground.
