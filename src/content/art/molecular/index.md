<div data-section="exhibition">

Molecular represents the Collective Anonymity. When people approach their real
selfs in the collective neuron a dendrite starts sparking until an anonymous
collective forms and the neuron axion lits up.

It was exposed in the primary hall of the [Centro de
Convenciones](https://www.cecbuenosaires.com.ar/) de Buenos Aires.

<div data-section="backstage">

The project was developed over several months, combining digital fabrication
techniques with traditional craftsmanship. The geodesic structure was carefully
designed to create an immersive experience.
