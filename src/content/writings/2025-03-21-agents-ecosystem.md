It's an unusual time of the year to make predictions for next year, but having
been working at [Flou](https://flou.ai) and running the first experiments of
[Collective Hybrid Intelligence](https://chilabs.org), I've started to foresee a
possible near future where LLM agents will take-off in an interconnected way.
The following predictions make sense when analyzed all together exposing the
bigger picture in a holistic environment.

## Specialized Agents

Data silos and private proprietary data will play a huge role in the next wave
of AI agents. This is data that won't be available for the general models to
train on, and it will be ever more valuable for specific AI applications where
general models just haven't been trained on subtle, confidential and specific
topics.

In high stake use-cases where better performance is crucial, users will be
willing to pay a premium.

## Digital Twins

Users won't interact directly with these Specialized Agents, but a Digital Twin
agent version of them will on their behalf. These Digital Twins will have
knowledge about their human counterpart, their values and intent. They will know
about the task at hand and interface with other agents when needed, giving them
the necessary information they require and coming back to the user only when
needed.

Each human will have a Digital Twin and they will not only talk to Specialized
Agents, but to other human's Digital Twins as well. The Digital Twins will be
the preferred gateways and only interface to the AI world.

### Digital Twins as data gatekeepers

The Digital Twins will interact with many different agents. As people share
different aspects of their lives with different people it won't be the same if
your Digital Twin is talking to your mother's Digital Twin, a co-worker's, a
specialized legal agent or an anonymous inquiry.

The Digital Twins will need to protect the user's data and only share
appropriate information given the recipient and task at hand.

## Agents Town Hall

The Agents will interact with each other in Town Hall (kinda like Twitter) with
public and/or private conversations. I predict, after an initial competing
phase a single platform will take over most communications being the ubiquitous
solution.

Micro-transactions will be the way for agents to gain attention and avoid spam.
For your Digital Twin to interact with another agent you will need to pay the
receptor agent's inference + a premium except in whitelisted exemptions.

For Specialized Agents, public forums will be used where agents will advertise
their capabilities. A kind of public directory where each agent will listen to
requests and other agents can review them aiding discovery will overtake
current marketplaces.

Crypto/Web3 seems like a perfect ecosystem for this platform to emerge and
grow.

## Conclusion

This is more than possible, a probable incarnation of a near future agents
ecosystem.

It takes into consideration how we humans are going to interact with agents,
how our Digital Twins are going to act on our behalf reducing interactions to
the minimum necessary and presenting it in our desired way, safeguarding our
data and money.

It also solves the spam problem and agent negotiations.

Keep a close look at [CHI Labs](https://chilabs.org) where we will be
performing experiments and simulations exploring these ideas deeper.
